An important public health question is determining the source of food or environmentally acquired diseases such as campylobacteriosis. In the absence of epidemiological information for each human case, the use of genomic information, such as multilocus sequence type, allows attribution of cases to sources by comparing the types observed in human cases to the types observed in food and environmental samples. Several statistical models are available for attribution, all of which involve estimating the distribution of sequence types on each source. The asymmetric island model models the sequence type distributions by estimating evolutionary parameters (mutation and recombination) in addition to migration rates between each source. A much simpler model is to use a Dirichlet distribution, informed by prior information and the observed types on each source, to model the sequence type distributions. We show that this simple model provides similar information as the island model for sequence types that are observed frequently, and that the island model provides additional information only for types that have not been observed frequently (or at all) among sources. Where epidemiological information is also available for cases, we show that attribution with either model may be improved. Using surveillance data from the Manawatu region of New Zealand, we show that the relationship between rurality and poultry or ruminant attribution may be modelled by a linear trend: cases from very rural areas are likely ruminant associated, cases from highly urban areas are likely poultry associated.
