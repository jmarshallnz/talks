Poster for source attribution
=============================

This is a poster for the source attribution work of Jing.

It uses [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/).

Each of the boxes in scribus link to a different image or latex
(latex is described within Scribus, but could probably be done in
separate files as well for preview outside of Scribus).

The R script is used to generate the ggplot2 figures. Data are
missing for the attribution as the raw files are quite large.
